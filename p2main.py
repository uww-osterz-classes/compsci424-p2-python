import threading  # standard Python threading library

# (Comments are just suggestions. Feel free to modify or delete them.)

# In addition to the main program, you will need at least one function
# for the producer thread and one function for the consumer thread.
# When you start a thread with a call to "threading.Thread", you will
# need to pass in the name of the function whose code should run in
# that thread.


# Producer function goes here


# Consumer function goes here
