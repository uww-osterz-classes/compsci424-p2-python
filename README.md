## About this repository and autograding

Use this template for Operating Systems Program 2 in Python. 

Autograding is not set up for this assignment, so no specific file name or project structure is needed. My starter code file is named `p2main.py`, but yours can have a different name. You can use additional Python files, but make sure to import them correctly.

Write only Python 3 code. Python 2 code is deprecated and is not guaranteed to work.

This Python template repository does not include a virtual environment. You are welcome to add any virtual environment that you like and push it to your own repository. If you just want to keep it simple and run plain Python code, that's fine too.

If you are encountering problems, please commit and push your current code, then [email me](osterz@uww.edu) with a description of what's happening. I will look at your repository on GitHub to try to help you debug.

## Advice for Python programmers

This advice is also posted on the Program 2 page on Canvas. Updates, if any, will be posted there.

In addition to the main program, you will need at least one function for the producer thread and one function for the consumer thread. When you start a thread with a call to `threading.Thread`, you will need to pass in the name of the function whose code should run in that thread.
